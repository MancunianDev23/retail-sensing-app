## TODO
* Better define config object

What if it looked like:
 Config --> Merge Config with Default --> Transform to s3 config -->
 ParseWebsite --> Transform Data -->  Handle actions (deploy, cloudfront, ...) --> Reporting


ACL might fix permissions issue that is posted on github


<!-- NOTE -->
* Added getters and updators and reporters concept. App should be refactored such
that getters only collect information, then pass state to the updators, who figure
out what actions to take, and then take them. They update the state object, and
return it. Reporters accept state object and report back somehow
